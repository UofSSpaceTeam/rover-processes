# Rover Processes

This is (will be) a collection of programs that will run on the rover.
We will start by porting Roveberrypy processes to the new
Robocluster framework.

Programs that go here should be relatively self contained,
if you have multiple files, put them in a folder with the
program entry being clearly named. If you have more than
a few files, consider creating a library in a new
repository instead.
